# Brookfield-Garden-And-Pet-Website
Website made for an assignment.
I used HTML/CSS(Sass), JavaScript and few parts in jQuery.
The website is responsive, by using Media queries.
I used CSS animation to create a full-page navigation menu.

To map the CSS file, while using Sass, I used the plugin "Sass live" in Visual Studio Code.
